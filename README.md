# Frequent-Itemsets
* Implementing SON algorithm using Apache Spark to find all the possible combinations of the frequent itemsets in MovieLens Ratings Dataset
* A-Priori is used for counting frequent item-set in each phase
* The first part, returns the combinations of frequent movies (as singletons, pairs, triples, etc…) that
were rated by male users and are qualified as frequent given a support threshold value.
* The second part, returns the combinations of frequent female users (as singletons, pairs,
triples, etc…) who rated the movies, based on a given support threshold value.
